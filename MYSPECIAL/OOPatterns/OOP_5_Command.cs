	 * Command Pattern
	 * 
	 * The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, allowing
	 * you to parameterize clients with queues, requests, or operations. It enables you to decouple the sender from the receiver, providing flexibility in the execution of commands and supporting undoable operations.
