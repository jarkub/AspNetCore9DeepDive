/*
 * Behavioral Design Patterns
 * 
 * Behavioral design patterns focus on how objects interact with each other and how they communicate
 * to accomplish specific tasks. These patterns address communication, responsibility,and algorithmic
 * issues in object-oriented software design. They help in defining clear and efficient communication mechanisms between objects and classes.
 * 
 * These patterns help in making the design more flexible, extensible, and maintainable by promoting
 * better communication and separation of concerns between objects and classes in the system. Each
 * pattern addresses specific design issues and provides a standardized solution to common problems
 * encountered in software development.
